## UX

The Homepage's main function will be to attract new users to register an account and for existing users to log in. So sign-up and log in options will be in clear eyesight as soon as the page is opened. Some extra functionality will be the ability to search for a movie or show log-inhe nav bar without first logging in or signing up. Once a search result is found an option will be presented to log-in a watchlist or seen list. If either of these buttons are clicked the user will be promted to log in or sign up.

Once the user is logged in they will be presented with a library of all the movies and shows saved to their lists. From here they can select the individual lists available to them or select an item from the full library, where they are given the ability to move the item between lists, give it a rating, add personal comments or delete the item.

### Colour Scheme

I have chosen a dark theme with purple highlights as I feel this best represented the 'Movie' experience. For the majority of the text I have selected a white color as this popped out more and makes the experience better for the user.

- `#F5F5F5` used for primary text.
- `#F79426` used for primary highlights and buttons.
- `#6B0E87` used for background colours.
- `#000000` used for secondary background colours.
- `#FF0000` used for buttons that have a permanent action.
- `#4CAF50` used for 'safe' buttons.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/000000-ff0000-4caf50-6b0e87-f79426-f5f5f5) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography

- [Amatic SC](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Amatic+SC) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## Features

### Existing Features

- **Navbar**
    - A simple navbar where the user can use the search bar to find movies and tv shows, navigate to the home page using the 'Home' link or by clicking the logo/title, navigate to the library page or log out.
    - If the user is new to the page or not yet logged in, the navbar gives the user the option to sign up or log in.

![screenshot](documentation/features/feature01-1.png)
![screenshot](documentation/features/feature01-3.png)
![screenshot](documentation/features/feature01-2.png)


- **Welcome section**

    - A clean and simple welcome section of the home page displaying the sites full name.
    - log in and sign up buttons have been added to the welcome page to make it easy for users to see, especially when vieing on a mobile device where the navbar log in and sign up links are hidden.

![screenshot](documentation/features/feature02-1.png) ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature02-2.png)


- **Popular Films and TV Shows**

    - This section uses an API to fetch data about the most popular films and tv shows.
    - Because this uses an API these titles will constantly be updated giving the user something new to look at when visiting the site.

![screenshot](documentation/features/feature03.png)

- **Footer**

    - Logo and title will link the user back to the homepage.
    - Social media links for the user to find out more about the site. These will open in a new tab.

![screenshot](documentation/features/feature04.png)

- **Log In and Sign Up Modals**

    - I have choosen to have modals for the log in and sign up options instead of directing the user to a separate page. I feel this is more user friendly. For example if the user decides not to log in or sign up at that time they dont have to navigate back to the homepage.
    - If the user clicks on the wrong button by mistake there is a link at the bottom of the modal that will take the user to the correct modal.
    - To close the modal the user can either click on the 'x' button or anywhere on the screen outside of the modal.
    - Once logged in the user will be directed to their library page.

![screenshot](documentation/features/feature05-1.png) ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature05-2.png)


- **Flash message modals**

    - I chose to display the flash messages within a modal because I did not like that the flash messages appeared at the top of the screen and would  push other elements down the page.
    - Another positive of using a modal to display the flash message is that the message could be closed once the user has read it keeping the page clean and tidy.

![screenshot](documentation/features/feature06-1.png) ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature06-2.png)

![screenshot](documentation/features/feature06-3.png) ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature06-4.png)


- **Bottom and side nav**

    - Once a user has signed up and is logged in they have a variety of other options available to them. These are all displayed on the bottom nav (for mobile users) and side nav (for desktop users).
    - The user can navigate back to the home page, library page or view thier watchlists or seenlists.
    - The Watchlists and Seenlists nav options have an expandable menu which allows the user to navigate to a specific list

![screenshot](documentation/features/feature07-4.png)


- **Search Results**

    - When the user searches for a title in the search bar this page will be loaded.
    - The API is access once again to find the details of the search title and are diplayed here for the user
    - The user does not have to be logged in to search for a title. But if they try to add the title to one of the lists, non registered users will be warned that they must be logged in to perform the action.

![screenshot](documentation/features/feature08-1.png)  ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature08-2.png)

- **Feature Details**

    - This page is only available to session users. It is accessed by clicking one of the titles that have been added to the users lists.
    - This page allows the user to change which list the title is in. If the user trys to add the title to a list that it is already in a modal flash message will promt the user.
    - Users can delete titles from thier lists witht the delete/trash button. A modal prompt will be shown to the user to confirm if they want to delete (see below).
    - Users can add thier own star rating from 1 to 5 stars.
    - Personal review or comments can also be added for each title.

![screenshot](documentation/features/feature09-1.png)  ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature09-2.png)  ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature09-3.png)

- **Poster menu options**

    - Each poster has an expandable menu accesed by clicking the three vertical dots.
    - This menu gives the user options to delete the title from the list or edit. choosing edit will direct the user to the feature details page.

![screenshot](documentation/features/feature10.png)

- **Delete modal prompt**

    - This modal prompt is displayed whenever a user try's to delete a title.
    - This is to capture any accidental clicks of the delete button.

![screenshot](documentation/features/feature11.png)

- **404 page**

    - This page displays when the user tries to navigate to a page that doesn't exist.
    - The page will refresh to the homepage after 10 seconds.

![screenshot](documentation/features/feature12.png)

- **500 page**

    - This page displays when there is an internal server error.
    - The page will refresh to the homepage after 10 seconds.

![screenshot](documentation/features/feature13.png)


### Future Features

- Autocomplete list for search bar
    - This feature will access the API as the user types and will display the closest matches in a dropdown list. This list will display the titles and the posters for all closest matches
- Where to watch
    - This will access an API that return information on what streaming services the currently viewed title can be watch on.
- Ratings from external sources
    - This will also access an API to gather the ratings or scores that have been given by other platforms such as imdb.com and rottentomatoes.com

## Database Design

My project uses a non-relational database with MongoDB, and therefore the database architecture
doesn't have actual relationships like a relational database would.

My database is called **mtdb**.

It contains 3 collections:

- **all_added_titles**
This collection holds a record of every TV Show and Film that has been added by all users and is used to help populate the Library, Watchlists and Seenlists.
    | Key | Type | Notes |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | _id | ObjectId() | |
    | id | String | |
    | poster_path | String | |


- **rating_review**
This collection stores the user specific rating and/or review that they have added to a Film or TV Show.
    | Key | Type | Notes |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | _id | ObjectId() | |
    | user_id | ObjectId() | Acts as Foriegn Key |
    | feature_id | String | |
    | rating | String | |
    | review | String | |


- **users**
This collection stores the users username and their hashed password. As well as arrays that store the film or tv show API id's.
    | Key | Type | Notes |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | _id | ObjectId() | |
    | username | String | |
    | password | String | uses Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) |
    | movie_list | Array | |
    | tv_list | Array | |
    | watchlist | Array | |
    | seenlist | Array | |

## Testing

For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://mtdb-movie-television-database-ff116cae015a.herokuapp.com).

### MongoDB Non-Relational Database

This project uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) for the Non-Relational Database.

To obtain your own MongoDB Database URI, sign-up on their site, then follow these steps:
- The name of the database on MongoDB should be called **insert-your-database-name-here**.
- The collection(s) needed for this database should be **insert-your-collection-names-here**.
- Click on the **Cluster** name created for the project.
- Click on the **Connect** button.
- Click **Connect Your Application**.
- Copy the connection string, and replace `password` with your own password (also remove the angle-brackets).

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `IP` | 0.0.0.0 |
| `MONGO_DBNAME` | user's own value |
| `MONGO_URI` | user's own value |
| `PORT` | 5000 |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.
- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:
- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:
- `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`
- *replace **app.py** with the name of your primary Flask app name; the one at the root-level*

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:
- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:
- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps, plus a few extras.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DB_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
os.environ.setdefault("DEVELOPMENT", "True")
```
